This is a great starting point. Let's see if we can make it better.</p>\n<p>One of the assumptions for linear models is that the data and the features we are giving it are related in a linear fashion, or can be measured with a linear distance metric. If a feature in our dataset has a high variance that's orders of magnitude greater than the other features, this could impact the model's ability to learn from other features in the dataset.</p>\n<p>Correcting for high variance is called normalization.

As one <a href=\"https://www.kjrh.com/news/local-news/red-cross-in-blood-donation-crisis\">prominent</a> example, blood donations slow down during busy holiday seasons. An accurate forecast for the future supply of blood allows for an appropriate action to be taken ahead of time and therefore saving more lives.</p>\n<p>In this notebook, we explored automatic model selection using TPOT and AUC score we got was 0.7850. This is better than simply choosing <code>0</code> all the time (the target incidence suggests that such a model would have 76% success rate). We then log normalized our training data and improved the AUC score by 0.5%. In the field of machine learning, even small improvements in accuracy can be important, depending on the purpose.</p>\n<p>Another benefit of using logistic regression model is that it is interpretable. We can analyze how much of the variance in the response variable (<code>target</code>) can be explained by other variables in our dataset.</p>"},{"metadata":{"dc":{"key":"73"},"tags":["sample_code"],"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Importing itemgetter\nfrom operator import itemgetter\n\n# Sort models based on their AUC score from highest to lowest\nsorted(\n    [('tpot', tpot_auc_score), ('logreg', logreg_auc_score)],\n    key=itemgetter(1),\n    reverse=True\n)","execution_count":206,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","execution_count":206,"data":{"text/plain":"[('logreg', 0.7890972663699937), ('tpot', 0.7849650349650349)]"},"metadata":{}}]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"name":"python3","display_name":"Python 3","language":"python"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.6.7","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":2}
